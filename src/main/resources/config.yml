#MinecraftBot configuration
#This file was generated by the plugin and contains all the default values.
#Not all required values have been filled in, however. To use this plugin, you must at least add to the
#'server' and 'channel' values under the 'connection' section.

#Missing values are assumed to be blank.
#Missing or incorrect values in true/false fields are assumed to be false.

#It is possible to change the configuration values and apply them while the plugin is active.
#You may do so with the '/minecraftbot reload' command. Note that everything under 'connection'
#is ignored while the plugin is running. The plugin itself must be reloaded to get the new values.

  nick_password: ''
  
  #bot_message_delay: The amount of time (in milliseconds) the bot should wait between sending messages.

line_formatting:
#You may edit how each line sent by this plugin looks like.
#This plugin does not edit the chat formatting in Minecraft.

#You may enter either IRC or Minecraft color codes into any formatting fields.
#The color codes will be automatically translated to the appropriate format.
#List of Minecraft color codes: http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Classic_server_protocol#Color_Codes
#Keep in mind that variables may contain text that override the color codes entered in these lines.

#Words surrounded by % signs are called variables. See the bottom of this file for more details.

#If a formatting line is blank, it is considered disabled and nothing will happen for that event.

  #For messages sent to IRC from Minecraft
  to_irc:
    #server: Messages sent by the "say" console command
    server: '<*Server> %message%'
    chat:   '<%name%> %message%'
    #action: A /me message
    action: '* %name% %message%'
    join:   '&b* %name% has joined the game'
    leave:  '&b* %name% has left the game'
    kick:   '&c* %name% has been kicked &r(%reason%&r)'
    # Due to the way death messages are worked with in Bukkit, the entire death message is represented
    # by %message%. The death message may be edited using another plugin. %name% is available to use here too.
    death:  '&c* %message%'
    
  #For messages sent to Minecraft from IRC
  to_minecraft:
    chat:   '#> <%name%> %message%'
    action: '#> * %name% %message%'
    join:   '#> &b* %name% has joined %channel%'
    part:   '#> &b* %name% has left %channel% &r(%reason%&r)'
    quit:   '#> &b* %name% has quit IRC &r(%reason%&r)'
    kick:   '#> &c* %kicker% has kicked %name% &r(%reason%&r)'
    nick_change:  '#> &b* %oldname% is now known as %name%'
    mode_change:  '#> &b* %name% set mode: %mode%'
    topic_change: '#> &b* %name% changed the topic to: &r%topic%'

#Some words surrounded by % signs are considered to be variables. When the lines are read by the
#plugin, the variables are replaced by some other value. The variables available per each line are different.
#The default line formatting values use all available variables for that specific line.
#
#There are some variables that are able to get data from other plugins:
#  %faction% - Factions: Player's faction tag, works in to_irc lines

#If you want more variables, feel free to send a request on the forums (or a pull request on github).
